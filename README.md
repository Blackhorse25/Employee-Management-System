Project Title: Employee Management System using Spring Boot and REST APIs Technologies Used: Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, REST API, MySQL, Maven, Java, Postman.

Description: 
• Developed a Spring Boot application to manage employee data with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using RESTful services. 
• Integrated Spring Data JPA for database interactions with MySQL, ensuring efficient data handling. 
• Implemented exception handling using custom ResourceNotFoundException to ensure error management. 
• Designed REST API endpoints for fetching employee details, adding new employees, updating existing records, and deleting employees. 
• Used Postman for API testing and validation. 
• Deployed the application locally with Maven, and maintained proper project structure with Controller, Service, Repository, and Model layers.

Key Responsibilities: 
• Built a REST API with endpoints to handle employee data. 
• Implemented service and repository layers to manage business logic and database interactions. 
• Handled validation and exception handling for robust error management. 
• Tested APIs using Postman for functional accuracy and performance. 
• Integrated MySQL database for persistence and used JPA for ORM.

Achievements: 
• Improved the API response time by optimizing queries and applying best practices for RESTful API design. 
• Ensured data consistency and accuracy with proper exception handling mechanisms. 
• Successfully delivered a fully functional employee management system for internal use.
